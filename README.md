# Travel-Planner-Cpp

**Travel-Planner-Cpp** is a console-based application that allows users to plan their trips efficiently using the basic concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in C++. The project demonstrates the use of classes, objects, and data encapsulation to manage travel-related information.

## Features
- **Trip Planning:** Add and view destinations for your trip.  
- **OOP Concepts:** Utilizes classes, objects, and methods to organize data.  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple console-based interaction for ease of use.  

## Technologies Used
- **C++** – Core language for implementing the travel planner.  
- **OOP Concepts** – Classes, objects, methods, and data encapsulation.  

## How to Use
1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`).  
2. Run the executable in your console/terminal.  
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to add destinations and view trip details.
